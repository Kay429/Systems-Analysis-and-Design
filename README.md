# Systems-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design? 

* The client was DriverPass, a small company dedicated to providing drivers' education. They wanted a web-based system that they could use to schedule driving lessons and deliver online courses to students. The system also needed to manage the students' information, including what tests they have taken and notes from their instructors.

What did you do particularly well?

* I am generally happy with my diagrams, specifically the activity diagrams. I feel like they are clear and concise.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

* I would add more details to the business requirements document. What I have is a good start, but there is not nearly as much detail as there could be. I also might move some of the requirements between sections. For example, I think some of my nonfunctional requirements fit better in the functional requirements section.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

* I took notes on everything that was said during the DriverPass interview and made sure that each note was addressed in my design. The DriverPass system has distinct user types that each use the system for different things, so in my design I made sure to consider what each user type needed and cater to all of them. It is important to consider the needs of the users because they are the ones the system is built for. They each should be able to use the system to complete certain tasks, and the system has failed if it does not provide them the services they need.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

* Designing software is an iterative process. When creating my diagrams, I began by writing lists of ideas to include. Next, I sketched out multiple versions of the diagrams on paper to figure out how I wanted them to look. This helped me to have a good idea of what I was going to create before I jumped into it. In the future, I would like to do this sort of thing for more parts of the design process. Looking at my work, I see that the parts I am most proud of are the ones that I created multiple prototypes for, and my least favorites were the ones that I rushed through. I hope to use this knowledge to improve my work moving forward.
